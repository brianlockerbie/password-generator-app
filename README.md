<p align="center"><b>Module #3 JavaScript Challenge: Password Generator</b></p>

<p><b>Description:</b> I created an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that I have written. The app is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.</p>
